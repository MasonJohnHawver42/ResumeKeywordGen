(Future)
Teaching Assistant, University of Minnesota, September 2022 - Present
Mentoring students to enhance their understanding of OCaml and functional programming principals.
Contributing to the development of course materials to ensure effective learning.

Projects:

Game Engine, June 2023
Developed a flexable and efficent Entity Componet System that minimizes cache misses, resulting in a 10X performance boost.
Integrated Lua as a Scripting Laungage into C++ to enable runtime laoding of behaviours, rules, and scripts.
Implimented a Graphical Interface for simulation editing, system control, and performance profiling.
Utilized the GPU for parellization, achiving signifigigant performace gains over 100X.

Automated Theorem Proving, May 2023
Designed an Interpeted language that can define rules for exploring a graph of statments. Implemented a modified Depth First Serach to find a natural proofs with improved performance and shorter paths. 
Developed Rule sets for calculus to simplify expressions and prove the derivative of real functions.

Facial Recognition, December 2022
Applied Pricipal Componet Analysis on a facial dataset, and implimented a linear softmax layer to achieve 85% test accuracy in facial recognition. Optimized the forward pass for efficent use with a Fast R-CNN network after facial reigons are found. 

Extracriculars:

Member, Robtics Club UMN, January 2023 - Present
Collaberating on ROS platforms for sensor fusion, creating comprehensive enviorment maps for motion planning. Contributing to the development of control systems for a wheeled mobile robot.
